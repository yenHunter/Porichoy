# Porichoy
> Let Them Know

## Description

**Porichoy** (Bengali for 'Identity') is a dynamic, modular, and highly customizable personal portfolio application built with the Laravel framework. It provides a robust platform for professionals of any field—developers, designers, writers, and more—to showcase their skills, experience, and projects to the world.

With a powerful admin panel and a flexible, profession-aware module system, Porichoy allows you to build and manage a personal website that truly represents your unique identity.

## Features

Porichoy comes packed with features designed for flexibility and ease of use:

* **Powerful Admin Dashboard:** A secure and comprehensive backend to manage all content, settings, and modules.
* **Dynamic Theming:** Instantly change the look and feel of your entire portfolio. The system is built to support multiple themes, allowing you to switch designs in a single click.
* **Complete Module System:** Your portfolio is built from modules. You can easily enable, disable, and reorder sections like:
    * Education
    * Work Experience
    * Projects
    * Skills
    * Testimonials
    * Blog / Articles
    * ...and more.
* **Profession-Based Configuration:** Tailor your portfolio's structure based on your career. A developer might want to highlight a GitHub repository, while a photographer might prioritize a gallery module.
* **Built-in Contact Form:** A ready-to-use contact form that sends messages directly to you, with validation and spam protection (if configured).
* **SEO Optimized:** Clean markup and management for meta titles and descriptions to help you get discovered on search engines.
* **Fully Responsive:** All default themes are designed to look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Social Media Integration:** Easily link and display your profiles from platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc.
